# Airgead Banking Project


## Description

The purpose of this program is to provide the user with a year by year
summary of yearly interest earned and opening balance totaled w/ the 
interest. The program reads in an inital deposit, monthly deposit, annual
interest, and the number of years of the bank term. Calculations are performed
and two tables are displayed with a summary of a bank balances per year. One
without monthly deposits and another with the monthly deposits.

## Road to Development

### What did you do particularly well?
I did very well by minimizing the amount of code in main by taking advantage of object oriented programming techniques and keeping functions in a separate file.

### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I would improve input validation so it only reads acceptable inputs.

### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

input validation was a challenge for me in this project when applying it in C++ code.

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Object oriented programming is a skill I can use in other projects and course work.

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I provided comments to explain what each function does and I used obvious naming fo variables and functions.
